# Props Destructuring and Default Values

## Overview

We'll cover props in further detail and explore how they help us make our
components more dynamic and reusable. We'll also talk about _destructuring_ and
how to give our props _default values_.

## Objectives

1. Explain how props make our components more dynamic and reusable
2. Pass props to a component by adding them as attributes when you render them
3. Use destructuring to access props more easily
4. Declare default values for destructured props
5. Render a component with props and default props

## Reviewing What We Know

Props allow us to pass values into our components. These values can be anything:
strings, objects (including arrays and functions), and so on. They give us the
opportunity to make our components more dynamic, and a **lot more** reusable.

For example, say we have a `<MovieCard />` component. A movie has a title, a
poster image, and many other attributes (or **prop**-erties!). Let's examine
what this `<MovieCard />` component would look like with _hardcoded_ data vs.
dynamic _prop_ data:

###### Hardcoded:

```js
function MovieCard {
  return (
    <div className="movie-card">
      <img src="http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/kqjL17yufvn9OVLyXYpvtyrFfak.jpg" alt="Mad Max: Fury Road" />
      <h2>Mad Max: Fury Road</h2>
      <small>Genres: Action, Adventure, Science Fiction, Thriller</small>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Passing in props

Mad Max: Fury Road is a ridiculously good movie, but what if we want to render a
movie card for another movie? Do we just write another component? No, that would
be silly! Instead, we write our components so that they make use of props, which
are passed from their parents.

To pass props to a component, you add them as attributes when you render them:

```js
const movieTitle = "Mad Max"
<MovieCard title={movieTitle} />
```

The value of a prop is passed in through JSX curly braces. As we read before,
this value can be anything: a variable, inline values, functions, etc. If your
value is a hardcoded string, you can pass it in through double quotes instead:

```js
<MovieCard title="Mad Max" />
```

Armed with that knowledge, let's update `MovieCard`s render method to make use of props:

###### Dynamic with Props:

```js
// assuming we are rendering a MovieCard component with the following JSX:
const title = "Mad Max"
const posterURL = "http://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342/kqjL17yufvn9OVLyXYpvtyrFfak.jpg"
const genresArr = ["Action", "Adventure", "Science Fiction", "Thriller"]

<MovieCard title={title} posterSrc={posterURL} genres={genresArr} />
```

```js
function MovieCard(props) {
  return (
    <div className="movie-card">
      <img src={props.posterSrc} alt={props.title} />
      <h2>{props.title}</h2>
      <small>{props.genres.join(", ")}</small>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now, does that not look cleaner and more reusable compared to our hard coded
example or what!?

## Destructuring Props

Since we know that a React function will only every get called with one argument,
and that argument will be the **props** object, we can take advantage of a modern
JavaScript feature called [destructuring][destructuring] to make our component even
cleaner:

```jsx
function MovieCard({ title, posterSrc, genres }) {
  return (
    <div className="movie-card">
      <img src={posterSrc} alt={title} />
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <small>{genres.join(", ")}</small>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, we're _destructuring_ the props argument in this function, which
will have `title`, `posterSrc`, and `genres` as keys. Destructuring allows us to take
the keys from the props object and assign them to variables with the same name. That
way, in our JSX, we don't have to use `props.whatever` everywhere - we can just access
the value directly!

Another benefit of destructuring props is that it makes it easier to tell what
props a component expects to be passed down from its parent. Consider these two
versions of the same component:

```js
// Without Destructuring
function MovieCard(props) {
  return (
    <div className="movie-card">
      <img src={props.posterSrc} alt={props.title} />
      <h2>{props.title}</h2>
      <small>{props.genres.join(", ")}</small>
    </div>
  );
}

// With Destructuring
function MovieCard({ title, posterSrc, genres }) {
  return (
    <div className="movie-card">
      <img src={posterSrc} alt={title} />
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <small>{genres.join(", ")}</small>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Looking at the version without destructuring, we'd have to find all the places
where `props` is referenced in the component to determine what props this
component expects. Looking at the version with destructuring, all we have to do
is examine the function parameters and we can see exactly what props the
component expects!

### Destructuring Nested Objects

We can also do some more advanced destructuring in cases when our props also
contain nested objects. For example:

```js
function App() {
  const socialLinks = {
    github: "https://github.com/liza",
    linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/liza/",
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <SocialMedia links={socialLinks} />
    </div>
  );
}

function SocialMedia({ socialLinks }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <a href={socialLinks.github}>{socialLinks.github}</a>
      <a href={socialLinks.linkedin}>{socialLinks.linkedin}</a>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Since `socialLinks` is an object, we can also destructure it to make our JSX
cleaner, either by destructuring in the body of the function:

```js
function SocialMedia({ socialLinks }) {
  const { github, linkedin } = socialLinks;

  return (
    <div>
      <a href={github}>{github}</a>
      <a href={linkedin}>{linkedin}</a>
    </div>
  );
}
```

...or by destructuring further in the parameters to our function:

```js
function SocialMedia({ socialLinks: { github, linkedin } }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <a href={github}>{github}</a>
      <a href={linkedin}>{linkedin}</a>
    </div>
  );
}
```

How much destructuring you do, and where you do it, is very much a matter of
preference. Try it out in some components and see what looks right to you!

## Default Values for Props

Let's switch gears here and imagine we are using our application to render a
list of hundreds of movies. Let's also assume the data set we have is not always
reliable when it comes to the urls of the movie posters.

In this case, we want to make sure our component doesn't render as an utter
disaster when the data is incomplete. In order to do this, we can use a
**default value** to assign a poster url when either a bad one, or none at all,
is provided. For this example, let's use the poster for Max Headroom as a
default, seeing as it is a perfect placeholder:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTJjNzczMTUtNzc5MC00ODk0LWEwYjgtNzdiOTEyZmQxNzhmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzMzMjU5NDY@._V1_UY268_CR1,0,182,268_AL_.jpg" />
</P>

Instead of passing in that default poster image in case we don't have one, we
can tell our `MovieCard` component to use a default value **if the `poster` prop
was not provided**. To do this, we can add default value to our destructured
props:

```js
function MovieCard({
  title,
  posterSrc = "http://i.imgur.com/bJw8ndW.png",
  genres,
}) {
  return (
    <div className="movie-card">
      <img src={posterSrc} alt={title} />
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <small>{genres.join(", ")}</small>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now, whenever we omit the `posterSrc` prop, or if it's undefined, the
`MovieCard` component will use this default value instead. That means we don't
have to worry about not passing in a poster all the time â€” the component will
take care of this for us!

### Why Use Default Values

An alternative way we could have handled bad urls would be to have `MovieCard`'s
parent component _check_ whether the `posterSrc` was valid/present, and then
pass some control value as a prop when it renders `MovieCard`. This is not ideal
compared to using a default prop within the `MovieCard` component.

Consider the following: in React, we want components to encapsulate the
functionality that they _can and should be responsible for_. Should the parent
component of `MovieCard` be responsible for managing the assignment of a default
movie poster source value? In our example, we think not. It makes more sense for
the component that is responsible for rendering the movie information and poster
to handle missing data.
